abstract = {The enhanced temporal capability of today's satellite sensors gives us large volumes of data to be processed, analysed, and visualized. Most of the conventional remote sensing software and land cover classification approaches, however, are only designed for single-date observations. To fully utilize the amount of data we receive and to improve land use/land cover mapping (LULC), technological advancements in machine learning, open-source processing, and GPU-accelerated hardware should be utilized. In this paper, a methodology for classification of temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 images was developed using open-source Python libraries. Light Gradient Boosting Machine, a machine learning algorithm that uses tree-based learning, was used to classify different land cover types based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Although the use of powerful machine learning algorithm resulted to more accurate land cover maps, temporal inconsistencies are still pervasive when dealing with time series outputs. To remove these temporal inconsistencies that resulted from misclassifications, temporal land cover filter based on transition probability matrix was applied on the time series land cover maps to modify the illogical land cover transitions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of the approach, which produced higher overall accuracy.}

	abstract = {Agriculture is a vast area with many different practices and requirements based on the crop, region, climate, and other aspects. The inputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and environmental conditions like climate, soil quality, and water availability strongly influence agriculture. When it pertains to rainfall, many crops depend on the quantity and timing of precipitation. Typically, the growth of plants, the germination of seeds, and the production of fruits and grains all require a certain amount of rainfall. However, issues like water logging, erosion, drought, and crop failure can also result from either too much or too little rainfall. In this study, we investigate the significance of rainfall prediction and propose an ensemble methodology for improving rainfall forecast accuracy for the benefit of paddy cultivation in Tripura. The proposed model involves utilizing the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model ensembled with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The model is developed and trained using more than 20 years of relevant weather data. We also compared the model with other state-of-the-art models that are already in use. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of SARIMA and LightGBM models both in stand-alone and ensembled modes. The accuracy improvement of 8\% and the R2-score of 83\% in the results impressively show the usefulness of the ensemble. Additionally, the proposed model's improved performance in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute error, with lower values of 72.09 and 55.242 mm, respectively, supports its feasibility and appropriateness for long-term rainfall forecasts.},

ABSTRACT = {A forest fire susceptibility map generated with the fire susceptibility model is the basis of fire prevention resource allocation. A more reliable susceptibility map helps improve the effectiveness of resource allocation. Thus, further improving the prediction accuracy is always the goal of fire susceptibility modeling. This paper developed a forest fire susceptibility model based on an ensemble learning method, namely light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to produce an accurate fire susceptibility map. In the modeling, a subtropical national forest park in the Jiangsu province of China was used as the case study area. We collected and selected eight variables from the fire occurrence driving factors for modeling based on correlation analysis. These variables are from topographic factors, climatic factors, human activity factors, and vegetation factors. For comparative analysis, another two popular modeling methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were also applied to construct the fire susceptibility models. The results show that temperature was the main driving factor of fire in the area. In the produced fire susceptibility map, the extremely high and high susceptibility areas that were classified by LR, RF, and LightGBM were 5.82%, 18.61%, and 19%, respectively. The F1-score of the LightGBM model is higher than the LR and RF models. The accuracy of the model of LightGBM, RF, and LR is 88.8%, 84.8%, and 82.6%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of them is 0.935, 0.918, and 0.868, respectively. The introduced ensemble learning method shows better ability on performance evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Abstract Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective tool for extracting interpretable information from big data and has been recently used as a promising approach for statistical downscaling. In this study, CNN models of different configurations are used to downscale daily temperature and precipitation over China with the use of large-scale atmospheric variables from ECMWF Interim reanalysis (ERI) and high-resolution gridded observations as predictors and predictands respectively. A 21-year period from 1979 to 1999 is used for calibration and a relatively warmer period during 2000–2017 is used for validation, which helps to examine the extrapolation capability of models. It is shown that model performance varies among different configurations. For a realistic multi-site downscaling over whole China, the convolutional process is indispensable and much more spatial features are required to parameterize temperature characteristics than precipitation. As compared with ERI, CNN model shows added value in reproducing geographic distributions of seasonal mean climate and seasonal cycle as well as reducing biases in mean and extreme percentiles for both temperature and precipitation. However, ERI performs better in terms of temporal correlations. Then the model is further compared with Generalized Linear regression Model (GLM) and two quantile mapping based techniques including bias correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) and bias correction and climate imprint (BCCI). It is shown that bias correction methods show superior performances to other models in reducing biases and representing temporal correlations especially for precipitation. CNN model achieves better precipitation downscaling performances than GLM. It also achieves good skills in reproducing seasonal cycle of temperature and frequency distributions of daily precipitation, and presents better stabilities between the calibration and validation period. These results indicate that CNN model has good potential for downscaling application over large regions (e.g., continents).},

ABSTRACT = {Forest fires may have devastating consequences for the environment and for human lives. The prediction of forest fires is vital for preventing their occurrence. Currently, there are fewer studies on the prediction of forest fires over longer time scales in China. This is due to the difficulty of forecasting forest fires. There are many factors that have an impact on the occurrence of forest fires. The specific contribution of each factor to the occurrence of forest fires is not clear when using conventional analyses. In this study, we leveraged the excellent performance of artificial intelligence algorithms in fusing data from multiple sources (e.g., fire hotspots, meteorological conditions, terrain, vegetation, and socioeconomic data collected from 2003 to 2016). We have tested several algorithms and, finally, four algorithms were selected for formal data processing. There were an artificial neural network, a radial basis function network, a support-vector machine, and a random forest to identify thirteen major drivers of forest fires in China. The models were evaluated using the five performance indicators of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 value, and area under the curve. We obtained the probability of forest fire occurrence in each province of China using the optimal model. Moreover, the spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas was mapped. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the four forest fire prediction models were between 75.8% and 89.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) values were between 0.840 and 0.960. The random forest model had the highest accuracy (89.2%) and AUC value (0.96). It was determined as the best performance model in this study. The prediction results indicate that the areas with high incidences of forest fires are mainly concentrated in north-eastern China (Heilongjiang Province and northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and south-eastern China (including Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province). In areas at high risk of forest fire, management departments should improve forest fire prevention and control by establishing watch towers and using other monitoring equipment. This study helped in understanding the main drivers of forest fires in China over the period between 2003 and 2016, and determined the best performance model. The spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas maps were produced in order to depict the comprehensive views of China’s forest fire risks in each province. They were expected to form a scientific basis for helping the decision-making of China’s forest fire prevention authorities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Concrete is one of the most commonly used materials in the construction of coastal and marine infrastructure despite the well known environmental impacts which include a high carbon footprint and high alkalinity ({\textasciitilde}pH 13). There is an ongoing discussion regarding the potential positive effects of lowered concrete pH on benthic biodiversity, but this has not been investigated rigorously. Here, we designed a manipulative field experiment to test whether carbonated (lowered pH) concrete substrates support greater species richness and abundance, and/or alter community composition, in both temperate and tropical intertidal habitats. We constructed 192 experimental concrete tiles, half of which were carbonated to a lower surface pH of 7-8 (vs. control pH of {\textgreater}9), and affixed them to seawalls in the United Kingdom and Singapore. There were 2 sites per country, and 6 replicate tiles of each treatment were collected at 4 time points over a year. Overall, we found no significant effect of lowered pH on the abundance, richness, or community assemblage in both countries. Separate site- and month-specific generalised linear models (GLMs) showed only sporadic effects: i.e. lowered pH tiles had a small positive effect on early benthic colonisation in the tropics but this was later succeeded by similar species assemblages regardless of treatment. Thus, while it is worth considering the modification of concrete from an environmental/emissions standpoint, lowered pH may not be a suitable technique for enhancing biodiversity in the marine built environment.},
