abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter emphasizes the importance of dissecting the different ways in which diverse types of virus control measures operate before taking decisions on which to deploy. Some control measures are nonselective affecting a wide range of viral pathogens or their vectors, but others are selective targeting a particular virus or vector species and may not be transferable between pathosystems. When combining control measures within integrated disease management (IDM) strategies, success is optimized by including measures that are selective and others that are non-selective, that address both kinds of sources and phases of virus spread, and that operate in as many different ways as possible. This also applies when devising ‘interim IDM strategies' to address short-term control needs. Such strategies are necessary when information on the effectiveness of control measures for the pathosystem concerned is insufficient, but the farmers' need to take remedial action is immediate. This chapter also addresses how to determine the effectiveness and reliability of control measures used alone or in combination, economic issues associated with deciding whether one or more measures should be deployed, the ‘big picture’ problems that increasingly hinder success in tackling virus diseases and the exciting opportunities provided by new technologies.}

   abstract = "▪ Abstract  Agricultural soils suppressive to soilborne plant pathogens occur worldwide, and for several of these soils the biological basis of suppressiveness has been described. Two classical types of suppressiveness are known. General suppression owes its activity to the total microbial biomass in soil and is not transferable between soils. Specific suppression owes its activity to the effects of individual or select groups of microorganisms and is transferable. The microbial basis of specific suppression to four diseases, Fusarium wilts, potato scab, apple replant disease, and take-all, is discussed. One of the best-described examples occurs in take-all decline soils. In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. Producers of this metabolite may have a broader role in disease-suppressive soils worldwide. By coupling molecular technologies with traditional approaches used in plant pathology and microbiology, it is possible to dissect the microbial composition and complex interactions in suppressive soils.",

    abstract = { Abstract The tomato late blight pandemic of 2009 made late blight into a household term in much of the eastern United States. Many home gardeners and many organic producers lost most if not all of their tomato crop, and their experiences were reported in the mainstream press. Some CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture) could not provide tomatoes to their members. In response, many questions emerged: How did it happen? What was unusual about this event compared to previous late blight epidemics? What is the current situation in 2012 and what can be done? It's easiest to answer these questions, and to understand the recent epidemics of late blight, if one knows a bit of the history of the disease and the biology of the causal agent, Phytophthora infestans. }

This review summarizes the knowledge on pathogenic strategies employed by the fungus to plunder the host. Furthermore, strategies employed by potential host plants in order to ward off an attack are discussed. Taxonomy: Alternaria spp. kingdom Fungi, subkingdom Eumycotera, phylum Fungi Imperfecti (a non-phylogenetic or artificial phylum of fungi without known sexual stages whose members may or may not be related; taxonomy does not reflect relationships), form class Hypomycetes, Form order Moniliales, form family Dematiaceae, genus Alternaria. Some species of Alternaria are the asexual anamorph of the ascomycete Pleospora while others are speculated to be anamorphs of Leptosphaeria. Host Range: Most Alternaria species are common saprophytes that derive energy as a result of cellulytic activity and are found in a variety of habitats as ubiquitous agents of decay. Some species are plant pathogens that cause a range of economically important diseases like stem cancer, leaf blight or leaf spot on a large variety of crops. Latent infections can occur and result in post-harvest diseases or damping-off in case of infected seed. Useful Website: <http://ag.arizona.edu/PLP/alternaria/online.htm>},

TMV additionally emerged as a prototypic model to investigate the biology of host plants, namely tobacco. TMV also exemplifies how a model system furthers novel, and often unexpected, developments in biology and virology. Today, TMV is used as a tool to study host-pathogen interactions and cellular trafficking, and as a technology to express valuable pharmaceutical proteins in tobacco. The history of TMV illustrates how pragmatic strategies to control an economically important disease of tobacco have had unexpected and transforming effects across platforms that impinge on plant health and public health. Tobacco mosaic virus: An RNA virus that causes mosaic disease in tobacco and similar effects in other plants, much used as an experimental subject; abbrev. TMV. (8) ",

abstract = {The enhanced temporal capability of today's satellite sensors gives us large volumes of data to be processed, analysed, and visualized. Most of the conventional remote sensing software and land cover classification approaches, however, are only designed for single-date observations. To fully utilize the amount of data we receive and to improve land use/land cover mapping (LULC), technological advancements in machine learning, open-source processing, and GPU-accelerated hardware should be utilized. In this paper, a methodology for classification of temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 images was developed using open-source Python libraries. Light Gradient Boosting Machine, a machine learning algorithm that uses tree-based learning, was used to classify different land cover types based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Although the use of powerful machine learning algorithm resulted to more accurate land cover maps, temporal inconsistencies are still pervasive when dealing with time series outputs. To remove these temporal inconsistencies that resulted from misclassifications, temporal land cover filter based on transition probability matrix was applied on the time series land cover maps to modify the illogical land cover transitions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of the approach, which produced higher overall accuracy.}

	abstract = {Agriculture is a vast area with many different practices and requirements based on the crop, region, climate, and other aspects. The inputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and environmental conditions like climate, soil quality, and water availability strongly influence agriculture. When it pertains to rainfall, many crops depend on the quantity and timing of precipitation. Typically, the growth of plants, the germination of seeds, and the production of fruits and grains all require a certain amount of rainfall. However, issues like water logging, erosion, drought, and crop failure can also result from either too much or too little rainfall. In this study, we investigate the significance of rainfall prediction and propose an ensemble methodology for improving rainfall forecast accuracy for the benefit of paddy cultivation in Tripura. The proposed model involves utilizing the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model ensembled with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The model is developed and trained using more than 20 years of relevant weather data. We also compared the model with other state-of-the-art models that are already in use. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of SARIMA and LightGBM models both in stand-alone and ensembled modes. The accuracy improvement of 8\% and the R2-score of 83\% in the results impressively show the usefulness of the ensemble. Additionally, the proposed model's improved performance in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute error, with lower values of 72.09 and 55.242 mm, respectively, supports its feasibility and appropriateness for long-term rainfall forecasts.},

ABSTRACT = {A forest fire susceptibility map generated with the fire susceptibility model is the basis of fire prevention resource allocation. A more reliable susceptibility map helps improve the effectiveness of resource allocation. Thus, further improving the prediction accuracy is always the goal of fire susceptibility modeling. This paper developed a forest fire susceptibility model based on an ensemble learning method, namely light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to produce an accurate fire susceptibility map. In the modeling, a subtropical national forest park in the Jiangsu province of China was used as the case study area. We collected and selected eight variables from the fire occurrence driving factors for modeling based on correlation analysis. These variables are from topographic factors, climatic factors, human activity factors, and vegetation factors. For comparative analysis, another two popular modeling methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were also applied to construct the fire susceptibility models. The results show that temperature was the main driving factor of fire in the area. In the produced fire susceptibility map, the extremely high and high susceptibility areas that were classified by LR, RF, and LightGBM were 5.82%, 18.61%, and 19%, respectively. The F1-score of the LightGBM model is higher than the LR and RF models. The accuracy of the model of LightGBM, RF, and LR is 88.8%, 84.8%, and 82.6%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of them is 0.935, 0.918, and 0.868, respectively. The introduced ensemble learning method shows better ability on performance evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Abstract Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective tool for extracting interpretable information from big data and has been recently used as a promising approach for statistical downscaling. In this study, CNN models of different configurations are used to downscale daily temperature and precipitation over China with the use of large-scale atmospheric variables from ECMWF Interim reanalysis (ERI) and high-resolution gridded observations as predictors and predictands respectively. A 21-year period from 1979 to 1999 is used for calibration and a relatively warmer period during 2000–2017 is used for validation, which helps to examine the extrapolation capability of models. It is shown that model performance varies among different configurations. For a realistic multi-site downscaling over whole China, the convolutional process is indispensable and much more spatial features are required to parameterize temperature characteristics than precipitation. As compared with ERI, CNN model shows added value in reproducing geographic distributions of seasonal mean climate and seasonal cycle as well as reducing biases in mean and extreme percentiles for both temperature and precipitation. However, ERI performs better in terms of temporal correlations. Then the model is further compared with Generalized Linear regression Model (GLM) and two quantile mapping based techniques including bias correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) and bias correction and climate imprint (BCCI). It is shown that bias correction methods show superior performances to other models in reducing biases and representing temporal correlations especially for precipitation. CNN model achieves better precipitation downscaling performances than GLM. It also achieves good skills in reproducing seasonal cycle of temperature and frequency distributions of daily precipitation, and presents better stabilities between the calibration and validation period. These results indicate that CNN model has good potential for downscaling application over large regions (e.g., continents).},

ABSTRACT = {Forest fires may have devastating consequences for the environment and for human lives. The prediction of forest fires is vital for preventing their occurrence. Currently, there are fewer studies on the prediction of forest fires over longer time scales in China. This is due to the difficulty of forecasting forest fires. There are many factors that have an impact on the occurrence of forest fires. The specific contribution of each factor to the occurrence of forest fires is not clear when using conventional analyses. In this study, we leveraged the excellent performance of artificial intelligence algorithms in fusing data from multiple sources (e.g., fire hotspots, meteorological conditions, terrain, vegetation, and socioeconomic data collected from 2003 to 2016). We have tested several algorithms and, finally, four algorithms were selected for formal data processing. There were an artificial neural network, a radial basis function network, a support-vector machine, and a random forest to identify thirteen major drivers of forest fires in China. The models were evaluated using the five performance indicators of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 value, and area under the curve. We obtained the probability of forest fire occurrence in each province of China using the optimal model. Moreover, the spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas was mapped. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the four forest fire prediction models were between 75.8% and 89.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) values were between 0.840 and 0.960. The random forest model had the highest accuracy (89.2%) and AUC value (0.96). It was determined as the best performance model in this study. The prediction results indicate that the areas with high incidences of forest fires are mainly concentrated in north-eastern China (Heilongjiang Province and northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and south-eastern China (including Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province). In areas at high risk of forest fire, management departments should improve forest fire prevention and control by establishing watch towers and using other monitoring equipment. This study helped in understanding the main drivers of forest fires in China over the period between 2003 and 2016, and determined the best performance model. The spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas maps were produced in order to depict the comprehensive views of China’s forest fire risks in each province. They were expected to form a scientific basis for helping the decision-making of China’s forest fire prevention authorities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Concrete is one of the most commonly used materials in the construction of coastal and marine infrastructure despite the well known environmental impacts which include a high carbon footprint and high alkalinity ({\textasciitilde}pH 13). There is an ongoing discussion regarding the potential positive effects of lowered concrete pH on benthic biodiversity, but this has not been investigated rigorously. Here, we designed a manipulative field experiment to test whether carbonated (lowered pH) concrete substrates support greater species richness and abundance, and/or alter community composition, in both temperate and tropical intertidal habitats. We constructed 192 experimental concrete tiles, half of which were carbonated to a lower surface pH of 7-8 (vs. control pH of {\textgreater}9), and affixed them to seawalls in the United Kingdom and Singapore. There were 2 sites per country, and 6 replicate tiles of each treatment were collected at 4 time points over a year. Overall, we found no significant effect of lowered pH on the abundance, richness, or community assemblage in both countries. Separate site- and month-specific generalised linear models (GLMs) showed only sporadic effects: i.e. lowered pH tiles had a small positive effect on early benthic colonisation in the tropics but this was later succeeded by similar species assemblages regardless of treatment. Thus, while it is worth considering the modification of concrete from an environmental/emissions standpoint, lowered pH may not be a suitable technique for enhancing biodiversity in the marine built environment.},

Identifying its driving factors is essential for stormwater management. A significant underestimation of flood risk is caused by ignoring the coercive effects of building configuration on urban flooding. Data-driven machine learning algorithms provide insights into how building configurations affect urban flooding. This study utilized a cascade modelling chain comprising XGBoost, SHAP and PDP algorithms to determine the components of flooding risk and its impacts on local neighborhoods. It also provided practical guidance for city planners when planning from a building metrics perspective to mitigate pluvial flood risks. The result showed that building configuration plays an influential role in urban hydrology. The influence of Building Congestion Degree (BCD) on peak runoff became evident in an extreme rainstorm scenario, and especially in situations with low BCD. In addition, the Standard Deviation of Building Volume (SDBV) and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) had significant impacts on peak runoff. There was a significant inhibitory effect of SDBV on surface runoff when it is below 2.5 * 104 m3, as well as a suppression of flooding when the FAR is below the threshold of 2.8. The improvement strategy on building configuration for stormwater management can be carried out during urban renewal process or new district planning.}

abstract = {Groundwater potential mapping (GPM) provides the valuable information on groundwater volume that can be withdrawn from the aquifer without affecting the environmental conditions. In this study, GPM was innovatively explored by including three typical climate factors - precipitation (PRE), evaporation (EVA), and ground surface temperature (GST) - and by taking into consideration a total of 23 conditional groundwater factors during the model construction. Three ensemble learning models are used for the modeling process: random forest (RF), XGBoost, and LightGBM. The study was conducted in the southern regions of Yinchuan Plain, which is known for its temperate continental climate with low precipitation and high evaporation. It was found that all six adopted models (i.e., RF-C, XGBoost-C, LightGBM-C, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM) made reasonable predictions of groundwater potential, with areas with high and very high potential concentrated in the southwest region, where the Yellow River enters the study area. The LightGBM-C model performs the best (OA: 0.769, F1 score: 0.667, AUC: 0.921), while the RF model performs the worst (OA: 0.654, F1 score: 0.4, AUC: 0.757). According to the LightGBM-C model, there are more productive wells in areas with high groundwater potential (22 wells, 0.0152 per km2), while fewer non-productive wells are found (3 wells, 0.0021 per km2). The performance of LightGBM-C and RF-C models has been notably enhanced by climate factors (AUC + 0.073, OA + 0.025, F1 score + 0.052 for LightGBM, and AUC + 0.073, OA + 0.051, F1 score + 0.149 for RF). The further cumulative importance results indicate that the three ensemble models which considered climate factors demonstrated a substantial sensitivity to PRE (27.78%), EVA (28.14%), and GST (23.34%). In arid and semi-arid regions, PRE and EVA are highly recommended factors for GPM, while DD (35.17%), EV (35.22%), NDVI (28.06%) and GWD (25.77%) are also confirmed to be important when climate factors are not taken into account.}

abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

However, supplementary information, such as multitemporal data and/or land surface temperature (LST), has the potential to improve the land cover classification accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, in order to map land covers, we evaluated the potential of multitemporal Landsat 8’s spectral and thermal imageries using a random forest (RF) classifier. We used a grid search approach based on the out-of-bag (OOB) estimate of error to optimize the RF parameters. Four different scenarios were considered in this research: (1) RF classification of multitemporal spectral images, (2) RF classification of multitemporal LST images, (3) RF classification of all multitemporal LST and spectral images, and (4) RF classification of selected important or optimum features. The study area in this research was Naghadeh city and its surrounding region, located in West Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. The overall accuracies of first, second, third, and fourth scenarios were equal to 86.48, 82.26, 90.63, and 91.82 \%, respectively. The quantitative assessments of the results demonstrated that the most important or optimum features increase the class separability, while the spectral and thermal features produced a more moderate increase in the land cover mapping accuracy. In addition, the contribution of the multitemporal thermal information led to a considerable increase in the user and producer accuracies of classes with a rapid temporal change behavior, such as crops and vegetation.},

Remote sensing data from Landsat 5 (TM) for 1986, Landsat 7 (ETM+) for 1998 and 2010, and Landsat 8 (OLI) for 2022 were used to classify LULC classes. To triangulate the satellite imagery results, field data from 178 randomly selected households and 15 local elders were used. The study results revealed that from 1986 to 2022, water bodies, forests, cultivated land, settlements, and bare land increased by 100\%, 37.84\%, 13.93\%, and 11.73\%, respectively. In contrast, grassland, and shrub and bushland areas decreased by 82.08\% and 18.84\%, respectively. Moreover, the results show that about 62.92\% of the landscape experienced at least one LULC transition, with 18.27\% net change and 43.65\% swap change. The findings show that most land covers have changed to cultivated land and settlements. The accuracy analysis of the Landsat images showed a satisfactory level, as the changes in LULC align with local perceptions. Local farmers ranked the factors influencing LULC change as follows: agricultural expansion, free grazing, overgrazing, firewood collection, topography, and poor land management, from most to least important. Similarly, local farmers ranked poverty, population growth, rainfall variability, lack of awareness about proper natural resource use, and government intervention, from most to least important, as the root causes of LULC change. Therefore, controlling the causes of LULC change and promoting sustainable resource use are crucial to prevent further LULC change and the loss of scarce natural resources, which are essential for maintaining landscape sustainability.},

First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

ABSTRACT = {Flooding is a severe natural hazard, which poses a great threat to human life and property, especially in densely-populated urban areas. As one of the fastest developing fields in remote sensing applications, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can provide high-resolution data with a great potential for fast and accurate detection of inundated areas under complex urban landscapes. In this research, optical imagery was acquired by a mini-UAV to monitor the serious urban waterlogging in Yuyao, China. Texture features derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrix were included to increase the separability of different ground objects. A Random Forest classifier, consisting of 200 decision trees, was used to extract flooded areas in the spectral-textural feature space. Confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy of the proposed method. Results indicated the following: (1) Random Forest showed good performance in urban flood mapping with an overall accuracy of 87.3% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.746; (2) the inclusion of texture features improved classification accuracy significantly; (3) Random Forest outperformed maximum likelihood and artificial neural network, and showed a similar performance to support vector machine. The results demonstrate that UAV can provide an ideal platform for urban flood monitoring and the proposed method shows great capability for the accurate extraction of inundated areas.},

    abstract = {The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is one of the most economically important vector-borne banana diseases throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin and presents a significant challenge to the agricultural sector. Current models of BBTV are largely deterministic, limited by an incomplete understanding of interactions in complex natural systems, and the appropriate identification of parameters. A stochastic network-based Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model has been created which simulates the spread of BBTV across the subsections of a banana plantation, parameterising nodal recovery, neighbouring and distant infectivity across summer and winter. Findings from posterior results achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate Bayesian computation suggest seasonality in all parameters, which are influenced by correlated changes in inspection accuracy, temperatures and aphid activity. This paper demonstrates how the model may be used for monitoring and forecasting of various disease management strategies to support policy-level decision making.},

Life cycles are surprisingly variable, including both sexual and asexual states, or only sexual states, or only asexual states. At least one species produces dematiaceous conidia. Analyses of rDNA sequences indicate that major lineages are more closely correlated with anamorphic features such as conidial ontogeny and morphology than with teleomorph features. Development of molecular clock models is enabling researchers to reconstruct patterns of coevolution and host-jumping, as well as ancient migration patterns. Geographic distributions of some species appear to be increasing rapidly but little is known about species diversity in many large areas, including North America. Powdery mildews may already be responding to climate change, suggesting they may be useful models for studying effects of climate change on plant diseases.",

abstract = {Abstract Fungicides inhibiting the mitochondrial respiration of plant pathogens by binding to the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex (complex III) at the Qo site (Qo inhibitors, QoIs) were first introduced to the market in 1996. After a short time period, isolates resistant to QoIs were detected in field populations of a range of important plant pathogens including Blumeria graminis Speer f sp tritici, Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht ex Fr) Poll, Plasmopara viticola (Berk \& MA Curtis ex de Bary) Berl \& de Toni, Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk \& MA Curtis) Rost, Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet and Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) Wint. In most cases, resistance was conferred by a point mutation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene leading to an amino-acid change from glycine to alanine at position 143 (G143A), although additional mutations and mechanisms have been claimed in a number of organisms. Transformation of sensitive protoplasts of M fijiensis with a DNA fragment of a resistant M fijiensis isolate containing the mutation yielded fully resistant transformants, demonstrating that the G143A substitution may be the most powerful transversion in the cyt b gene conferring resistance. The G143A substitution is claimed not to affect the activity of the enzyme, suggesting that resistant individuals may not suffer from a significant fitness penalty, as was demonstrated in B graminis f sp tritici. It is not known whether this observation applies also for other pathogen species expressing the G143A substitution. Since fungal cells contain a large number of mitochondria, early mitotic events in the evolution of resistance to QoIs have to be considered, such as mutation frequency (claimed to be higher in mitochondrial than nuclear DNA), intracellular proliferation of mitochondria in the heteroplasmatic cell stage, and cell to cell donation of mutated mitochondria. Since the cyt b gene is located in the mitochondrial genome, inheritance of resistance in filamentous fungi is expected to be non-Mendelian and, therefore, in most species uniparental. In the isogamous fungus B graminis f sp tritici, crosses of sensitive and resistant parents yielded cleistothecia containing either sensitive or resistant ascospores and the segregation pattern for resistance in the F1 progeny population was 1:1. In the anisogamous fungus V inaequalis, donation of resistance was maternal and the segregation ratio 1:0. In random mating populations, the sex ratio (mating type distribution) is generally assumed to be 1:1. Therefore, the overall proportion of sensitive and resistant individuals in unselected populations is expected to be 1:1. Evolution of resistance to QoIs will depend mainly on early mitotic events; the selection process for resistant mutants in populations exposed to QoI treatments may follow mechanisms similar to those described for resistance controlled by single nuclear genes in other fungicide classes. It will remain important to understand how the mitochondrial nature of QoI resistance and factors such as mutation, recombination, selection and migration might influence the evolution of QoI resistance in different plant pathogens. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract = {Summary Oomycetes form a deep lineage of eukaryotic organisms that includes a large number of plant pathogens which threaten natural and managed ecosystems. We undertook a survey to query the community for their ranking of plant-pathogenic oomycete species based on scientific and economic importance. In total, we received 263 votes from 62 scientists in 15 countries for a total of 33 species. The Top 10 species and their ranking are: (1) Phytophthora infestans; (2, tied) Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; (2, tied) Phytophthora ramorum; (4) Phytophthora sojae; (5) Phytophthora capsici; (6) Plasmopara viticola; (7) Phytophthora cinnamomi; (8, tied) Phytophthora parasitica; (8, tied) Pythium ultimum; and (10) Albugo candida. This article provides an introduction to these 10 taxa and a snapshot of current research. We hope that the list will serve as a benchmark for future trends in oomycete research.},

abstract = {Pathogens, like other consumers, mediate the outcome of competitive interactions between their host species. Ongoing efforts to integrate pathogens into plant community ecology could be accelerated by greater conceptual unification. Research on plant pathogens has mainly focused on a variety of disparate mechanisms—the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, plant–soil feedbacks, competition–defense trade-offs, escape of invasive plants from their enemies, and epidemic-driven community shifts—with limited recognition of how these mechanisms fit into the broader context of plant coexistence. Here, I extend an emerging theoretical framework for understanding species coexistence to include various pathogen impacts on plant communities. Pathogens can promote coexistence by regulating relative abundance or by reducing the disparities between species in fitness that make coexistence more difficult. Conversely, pathogens may undermine coexistence by creating positive feedbacks or by increasing between-species fitness differences. I review the evidence for these pathogen-mediated mechanisms, and I reframe the major hypotheses in a community ecology context in order to understand how the mechanisms are related. This approach generates predictions about how various modes of pathogen attack affect plant coexistence, even when direct impacts on host relative abundance are difficult to measure. Surprisingly, no study gives direct empirical evidence for pathogen effects on mutual invasibility, a key criterion for coexistence. Future studies should investigate the relationship between pathogen attack and host relative abundance, in order to distinguish between mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Global environmental changes caused by natural and human activities have accelerated in the past 200 years. The increase in greenhouse gases is predicted  to continue to raise global temperature and change water availability in the  21(st) century. In this Review, we explore the profound effect the environment  has on plant diseases - a susceptible host will not be infected by a virulent  pathogen if the environmental conditions are not conducive for disease. The  change in CO(2) concentrations, temperature, and water availability can have  positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, as each disease  may respond differently to these variations. However, the concept of disease  optima could potentially apply to all pathosystems. Plant resistance pathways,  including pattern-triggered immunity to effector-triggered immunity, RNA  interference, and defense hormone networks, are all affected by environmental  factors. On the pathogen side, virulence mechanisms, such as the production of  toxins and virulence proteins, as well as pathogen reproduction and survival are  influenced by temperature and humidity. For practical reasons, most laboratory  investigations into plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular level focus on  well-established pathosystems and use a few static environmental conditions that  capture only a fraction of the dynamic plant-pathogen-environment interactions  that occur in nature. There is great need for future research to increasingly use  dynamic environmental conditions in order to fully understand the  multidimensional nature of plant-pathogen interactions and produce  disease-resistant crop plants that are resilient to climate change.},

    abstract = { We develop a Bayesian methodology for systemic risk assessment in financial networks such as the interbank market. Nodes represent participants in the network, and weighted directed edges represent liabilities. Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network. An R package implementing the methodology is provided. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation. }
